# Soundsight
An iOS app to help users navigate the world by turning depth information into pleasant sounds.

Made by [Gile Hamilton-Fletcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giles-hamilton-fletcher-808a5335/) at NYU Langone Health, [Jamie Ward](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p92444-jamie-ward) and [James Alvarez](https://jamesalvarez.co.uk/) at the Unversity of Sussex.

## Getting started

If you want to get this building you will need to install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), and you will also need the [Flir One SDK](https://developer.flir.com/mobile/flironesdk/), and the [OpenCV2 framework](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d5/da3/tutorial_ios_install.html) - which are too big to fit in Github.

The full bells and whistles version of the app is on the main branch.

A version that we are in the process of releasing on the app store is in the app_store branch.
