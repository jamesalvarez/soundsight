# Soundsight
An iOS app to help users navigate the world by turning depth information into pleasant sounds.

Made by [Giles Hamilton-Fletcher]([Giles Hamilton-Fletcher](https://twitter.com/Gilouxy) at NYU Langone Health) at NYU Langone Health, [Jamie Ward](https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p92444-jamie-ward) and [James Alvarez](https://jamesalvarez.co.uk/) at the University of Sussex.

# Research background
This visual-to-audio sensory substitution App was originally developed under the name 'Synaestheatre.' Research with persons who are blind or visually-impaired indicated that the responsivity, aesthetics, and use of depth information was well received by potential end users [1]. A more detailed understanding of the technical features of the App can be found in our SoundSight publication [2].

## Getting started

If you want to get this building you will need to install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), and you will also need the [Flir One SDK](https://developer.flir.com/mobile/flironesdk/), and the [OpenCV2 framework](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/d5/da3/tutorial_ios_install.html) - which are too big to fit in Github.

The full bells and whistles version of the app is on the main branch.

A version that we are in the process of releasing on the app store is in the app_store branch.
